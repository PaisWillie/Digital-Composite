\maketitle

% Show an item is done by   \item[\done] Frame the problem
% Show an item will not be fixed by   \item[\wontfix] profit

\begin{itemize}
  
\item Identifier naming
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Identifier names are consistent
  \item Identifier names are meaningful
  \end{todolist}

\item Coding
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Source code in the src folder
  \item Comments on ``what'' not ``how''
  \item Avoid hard-coded constants (other than maybe 0 or 1)
  \item Consistent indentation
  \item Explicit identification of coding standard being followed
  \item Code standard is followed
  \item Parameters in the same order for all functions
  \end{todolist}

\item Relation to other documents
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Descriptive name for source code files
  \item Mapping to module guide (system architecture) is clear, may require a
    document explicitly mapping between modules and code files
  \item Show mapping between MIS symbols (low-level design document) and code
  symbols
  \end{todolist}

\item Readability
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Code is reasonably understandable to someone that knows the
    programming language, but is new to the project
  \item Esoteric language features avoided when a simpler language feature
    could be used
  \item Incomplete code is flagged with a suitable marker, such as ``TO DO''?
  \end{todolist}

\item \wss{This checklist is not exhaustive.  More items should be added.}

\end{itemize}
