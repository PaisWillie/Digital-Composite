\section{Introduction}
\label{SecIntro}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software. A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team (Parnas et al., 1984). We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding (Parnas, 1972). This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes. Design for change is valuable in scientific computing,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules laid out by Parnas et al. (1984), as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
  \item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
  \item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software. The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{New project members}: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
  \item \textbf{Maintainers}: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
  \item \textbf{Designers}: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section~\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section~\ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section~\ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section~\ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section~\ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section~\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.


\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac1}:] Supporting additional hardware, such as new touchscreen displays or tablets, to ensure compatibility with future device upgrades and varying specifications.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac2}:] Modifying input data formats to align with updated composite structures or metadata provided by Lifetouch.
\item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac3}:] Enhancing data processing workflows to adapt to different composite formats and improve OCR preprocessing accuracy.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac4}:] Scaling the system to include graduation composites from additional faculties or departments across the university.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac5}:] Updating the OCR model to accommodate higher-resolution composites or address accuracy improvements in text extraction.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac6}:] Adding new user roles, such as external recruiters or event organizers, to expand the system's usability and access controls.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac7}:] Redesigning the user interface to meet evolving accessibility standards and usability feedback for a better experience.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac8}:] Extending the database schema to store new metadata, such as additional student achievements or career milestones.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac9}:] Integrating the system with McMaster’s existing alumni and event management platforms to streamline user engagement.
  \item [\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{ac10}:] Adjusting backend processes to comply with updates to privacy policies, legal regulations, or internal university standards.
\end{description}


\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The source of the input data will always be from predefined repositories, such as LifeTouch or McMaster databases.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The system will always display graduation composites on touchscreen interfaces and other devices as defined during development.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The primary goal of the system will remain focused on facilitating the browsing and searching of graduation composites for students, alumni, and staff.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The search functionality will always rely on a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) data and metadata stored within the system.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The backend database architecture will remain relational (or NoSQL, as selected initially) to meet system scalability and storage requirements.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The system will only support English as the primary language for search and display functionalities.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The project will be exclusively deployed on McMaster’s internal infrastructure, adhering to university IT policies and avoiding external hosting solutions.
  \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] The privacy and security protocols implemented will always follow GDPR and university policies, ensuring compliance with data handling standards.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

The GradSight system is modularized based on the principle of \textit{information hiding} to ensure each module encapsulates specific responsibilities and secrets. The hierarchy is structured to support ease of development, future scalability, and independent module testing. The table below summarizes the system’s decomposition:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Module Hierarchy}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Level 1} & \textbf{Level 2} \\
\hline
Hardware-Hiding & M1: Cloud Module \\
\hline
Behaviour-Hiding & M2: Input Module \newline
                 & M3: Data Upload Module \newline
                 & M4: OCR Processing Module \newline
                 & M5: Output Storage Module \\
\hline
Software Decision & M6: UI Parsing Module \newline
                  & M7: Graphical User Interface Module \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This hierarchy supports a \textit{layered design} where each module at a higher level may depend on the services of lower-level modules. For example, the UI Parsing module (M6) depends on the Upload (M3), OCR (M4), and Output Storage (M5) modules to function correctly. The Cloud Module (M1) hides low-level cloud interaction details from all others.


\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design}
\label{SecConnection}

The design of GradSight ensures that every requirement identified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is addressed by one or more modules in the system. Each requirement category has been mapped to modules based on their responsibilities and interactions. This section provides a brief overview of how the major functional and nonfunctional requirements are supported by the system design.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Functional Requirements (FR-1 to FR-5):} 
  These requirements involve uploading, parsing, storing, and viewing composite data. Modules M2 (Input), M3 (Upload), M4 (OCR), M5 (Output), M6 (UI Parsing), and M7 (GUI) collectively fulfill these tasks. For example, M3 handles the file upload, M4 extracts text and position data, and M7 provides the user interface to search and view composites.

  \item \textbf{Nonfunctional Requirements (NFR-1 to NFR-3):}
  These are addressed through efficient cloud operations and performance optimization in modules M1 (Cloud), M4 (OCR), and M5 (Output). For instance, fast image parsing is ensured through optimized OCR and AWS Lambda functions (M4), and concurrent access is handled via scalable database storage in M5.

  \item \textbf{Security and Privacy (SEC, PRIV):}
  Input validation (M2, M6), secure data handling (M1, M5), and access control via the admin interface (M6, M7) ensure the system is GDPR-compliant and secure against unauthorized access. Logging of failed attempts and fallback mechanisms are also integrated.

  \item \textbf{Adaptability and Maintainability (ADP-1, SUP-1):}
  Modular decomposition was performed with future changes in mind. For example, M5 is designed to support new metadata fields without affecting other modules, and M1 allows new composite files to be added without downtime. Support documentation and system logs are provided through M6 and M1.

  \item \textbf{Traceability:} 
  A full traceability matrix is presented in Section~\ref{SecTM}, which explicitly maps each requirement to its responsible module(s). Anticipated and unlikely changes are listed in Section~\ref{SecChange}, showing how likely evolution points were considered during decomposition.
\end{itemize}



\section{Module Decomposition}
\label{SecMD}
Modules are decomposed according to the principle of information hiding. The Secrets field highlights the design decisions encapsulated by the module. The Services field summarizes the visible functionality provided. The Implemented By field explains what technology or component is responsible for implementing the module.

\section{Traceability Matrix}
\label{SecTM}
This section provides traceability between the system’s requirements and the corresponding modules in the design. It also identifies how anticipated changes may impact the modular structure of the system. This traceability is critical for ensuring design alignment with stakeholder needs, system safety, and future scalability.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules}
\label{SecUse}
This section describes the \textit{use} relationship between modules. Module A \textbf{uses} Module B if the correct operation of A depends on services provided by B. This relationship implies a direct dependency in implementation, such as function calls or API usage.

Figure~\ref{fig:usehierarchy} illustrates the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of use relationships among modules. The design ensures that upper-layer modules are simpler and rely on well-encapsulated lower layers.

\section{User Interfaces}
\label{SecUI}

This section presents the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) designed for GradSight. The system is built for a touchscreen display, enabling users to upload, search, and view composite images interactively. The interfaces are powered primarily by Modules M6 (UI Parsing) and M7 (GUI), with support from backend modules for data retrieval and processing.
