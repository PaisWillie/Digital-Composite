The CA files are for a Commonality Analysis - they are only needed for projects that are actually a program family, or software product line.  For projects that are not a program family, these files should be deleted.

The SRS files are for a Software Requirements.  The template used in the files is for scientific computing.  If you project is not scientific computing, you should NOT use this template.  There are others that are more appropriate.  The file does provide some nice examples though of how LaTeX can be used.
