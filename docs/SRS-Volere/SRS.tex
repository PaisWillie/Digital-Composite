\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The GradSight project is designed to modernize the way graduation composites are displayed and managed within McMaster University's Faculty of Engineering. Currently, physical composites are difficult to access and maintain, hindering the tool to alumni, students, and faculty. By creating a digital, scalable platform, our project aims to provide an accessible, user-friendly system for browsing, searching, and interacting with graduate composites. This system is intended to improve the user experience, allowing for access to historical and future composites, while ensuring security and privacy.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The primary goals of the project are to develop a functional and scalable digital application that provides composite management for the Faculty of Engineering. The project focuses on creating a long-term solution that can handle the needs of both current and future graduating classes. Additionally, our team aims to implement an intuitive user experience with robust data management, including the integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), if necessary, for digitizing physical composites.

\textbf{The IT and Maintenance Staff:} These are personnel who, after deployment, do all the technical work to update software and deal with the maintenance of the system. They need administrative tools to understand and troubleshoot problems as fast as possible. \par
\textbf{System Admins:} Their job is to keep a back-end database management system updated, ensuring security but also updating and modifying the information in the system whenever needed.
\section{Mandated Constraints}

\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Security \& Privacy:} The system will adhere to McMaster University's policy on data protection, since information dealing with alumni is sensitive. Alumni information stored and processed in the system should be encrypted, and access must be granted to authorized users only.
  \item \textbf{Touchscreen Compatibility:} The system should be optimized for different types of hardware, ranging from larger displays down to iPads and tablets, to provide a seamless user experience across hardware.
  \item \textbf{Limited in External Access:} The system will be running over McMaster University's internal servers, which give absolutely no access from the outside to on-campus use only.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\textbf{Hardware:} The system resides on McMaster University's large touchscreen displays. It should also be accessible on smaller devices, such as iPads and other types of tablets.

\textbf{Software:} The project will implement a responsive web application for a great experience on different screen sizes. It will be hosted on McMaster Internal Servers, and data will be securely managed on an encrypted database.

\textbf{Operating Systems:} It should be running a Linux-based OS on the backend on mini-PCs; for a web application, it must work on multiple platforms like iOS and Android.

\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
\textbf{Lifetouch:} It can provide composite images of alumni. The system should integrate with the image repositories at Lifetouch via a secure mechanism. It shall respect all privacy agreements.

\textbf{University Systems:} The project may use existing McMaster IT infrastructure for data storage, user authentication, and network access.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
\textbf{Version Control:} It provides version control to maintain the issue-tracking history and thus helps the team work together smoothly.

\textbf{Web Frameworks:} The responsive web application will be built using off-the-shelf web frameworks.

\textbf{DBMS:} Alumni data, photos, and logs about the activity of its registered users will be stored in the database.

\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
\textbf{Development Environment:} Most of the work would be in a hybrid model; some work will be completely remote through Microsoft Teams, while hands-on things, such as setting up hardware and testing, will be in-person.

\textbf{Campus Deployment:} The system will be installed in appropriate locations at McMaster University, 2nd and 3rd floors of JHE, and near the Alumni and Recruitment office. Regular communication with on-campus IT services and facilities management will be needed.

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsection{Relevant Facts}

The target users include alumni, current students, and faculty members who require an intuitive interface to browse and search through digital class composites.

The system is expected to run on interactive touchscreen displays located within McMaster University buildings, as well as be accessible via desktop interfaces.

The project stakeholders include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Faculty of Engineering (project sponsor)
  \item Lifetouch (external photography provider)
  \item McMaster University IT Services (system host and post-deployment support)
\end{itemize}

The system will be developed using an agile approach, with development roles designated within the team to streamline collaboration. Responsibilities include note-taking, client communication, quality assurance, and documentation review.

A modular architecture will support maintainability and scalability across multiple user-facing devices and data sources.

\subsection*{Assumptions}

\subsection{Assumptions (Continued)}

\textbf{Availability of Digital Images:} It is assumed that LifeTouch will provide the required digital versions of past composites in a timely manner and with sufficient image quality for OCR to function effectively.

\textbf{OCR Reliability:} The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is assumed to work effectively in converting printed composites into digital formats, with minimal manual intervention required. In case of OCR errors, manual entry will be a fallback solution.

\textbf{Internet Accessibility:} Users will have consistent access to the internet to browse and search the digital composites, as the platform is expected to be hosted online and not available offline.

\section{The Scope of the Work}

\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current situation is that there are physical composites around the campus, specifically in the JHE building. These photographs are framed and placed on the wall of the buildings, scattered. Additionally, with more composites arising as years go by, there becomes limited space in the JHE building to accommodate engineering composites.

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The system is intended to run on touchscreen displays located on the second and third floors of the John Hodgins Engineering (JHE) building at McMaster University. It allows users (students, alumni, and faculty) to browse, search, and view composite images of graduating students. The backend is hosted on McMaster's internal servers, with integrations to external systems for photo data and identity verification.
\newline
The context diagram below illustrates the primary external systems, user roles, and their interactions with the system.

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this capstone project?}

Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain-specific knowledge from the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hammad} — One skill that our team will collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this capstone project will be learning privacy and security protocols and how to implement them.
    
    \item \textbf{Willie} — To successfully complete this capstone project, our team will need to know how to develop with frontend frameworks, one that is specific to handling touch inputs from a user. We will need to understand how to both program and deploy our interface solution to a display, running our application locally to the device.
    
    \item \textbf{Zahin} — Our team will need to learn skills in data integration, which involves connecting the application up to the university's existing systems or outside data sources, such as Lifetouch. This knowledge is going to be important in ensuring ease of movement of data and updating of a system with the latest information.
    
    \item \textbf{Henushan} — We would need to learn how to deploy code using frameworks and tools like Jenkins and Helios. When we are working with a user interactive screen, a scalable server would need to be in place.
    
    \item \textbf{Wajdan} — A skill that our team needs to learn is how to make and leverage reusable components. By creating components that can be used across multiple projects or areas of the same project, we can save time and reduce redundant work. It’ll help us maintain consistency in both design and functionality, making sure that our work stays efficient and scalable. Also, learning how to do this means understanding how to break down our code or designs into smaller, modular pieces that can be easily adapted and reused without constant rewriting.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hammad} — For privacy and security protocols, one approach to this would be watching videos and reading documents on how these are implemented and used in projects. The other approach would be to work with the developers currently at McMaster and LifeTouch to understand how the protocols used on their systems currently work. I will choose the first approach because I can learn more in depth and at my own pace to understand. In addition, I can reach out to the developers afterwards for further information.

    \item \textbf{Willie} — To acquire the skill of frontend development, one approach would be to research any of the widely available online resources on the topic. Where tutorial videos and documentation is readily available to learn from, I will be able to understand how to develop and deploy our solution to our digital interface. Another approach would be to learn by practice, attempting to develop smaller-scale applications until I am more comfortable with the knowledge, so I can apply it towards the success of our capstone project.

    \item \textbf{Zahin} — To acquire the skills in backend development and database management, one approach would be online classes or tutorials focused on backend programming and designing databases, which will give a good foundation. The other way would be talking to the senior developers at McMaster who deal with the university's data systems for practical insights and best practices. We will adopt the former approach because it gives us an ample opportunity to understand the concepts through structured learning before applying them to the project.

    \item \textbf{Henushan} — To deepen our understanding in deployment and dev-ops tools, we would need to review and go through documentation and even watch tutorials on infra and setup. From project to project, it will be different but the underlying steps should be similar which we can work and improve on. Additionally, working on setting up personal projects using these tools would prove to be a useful aid. With more practice and familiarity with these tools, our deployment practices will inevitably improve.

    \item \textbf{Wajdan} — To properly understand how to build reusable components, we would need to grasp a few key concepts. First, we need to understand modularity—how to break down complex systems into smaller, independent units that can function in isolation but also work seamlessly when combined. We also need to master separation of concerns, ensuring each component handles a single responsibility to make it easier to maintain and reuse. The team will use both of these approaches in order to get more practice and get hands-on experience when dealing with reusable components.
