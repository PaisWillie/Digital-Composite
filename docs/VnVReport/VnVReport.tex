\section{Changes Due to Testing}

Verification and validation testing resulted in several actionable insights and improvements to the GradSight system. This section outlines the specific issues discovered during testing, the test cases responsible for uncovering them, and the changes implemented in response.

\begin{longtable}{|p{4.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case / Validation Activity} & \textbf{Feedback / Observation} & \textbf{Change Implemented} \\
\hline

NFR-UH-02: Minimal Learning Curve & Users were confused during composite upload due to unclear button labels and layout. & Labels on upload buttons were revised for clarity. Additional helper text and tooltips were added near metadata fields. \\
\hline

NFR-UH-03: On-Screen Guidance & Some users did not notice tooltips or first-time overlays on touchscreen devices. & The overlay system was revised to support tap-based guidance and larger visual cues. Tooltip timing and contrast were adjusted. \\
\hline

Survey Feedback from Usability Testing (Section 2.7) & 2/5 users said system instructions were too vague or wordy. & All instructional text was rewritten to use active, second-person phrasing with simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. \\
\hline

NFR-SR-02: Role-Based Access Control & Manual testing revealed some admin-only pages were accessible via direct URL. & Backend route protection was added for all admin endpoints. Unauthorized access returns a 403 error and is logged in the audit system. \\
\hline

Kiosk Simulation (NFR-OE-02) & Text was hard to read in bright lighting during simulation. & Default font contrast was increased and minimum font size raised by 15\% across all screens. \\
\hline

NFR-CO-02: Legal and Standards Compliance & Placeholder privacy policy was insufficient for GDPR-like standards. & A proper draft of a McMaster-aligned privacy policy was created and linked in the footer. GDPR-compliance roadmap added to documentation. \\
\hline

\end{longtable}

These changes demonstrate how stakeholder observations and structured testing directly improved usability, security, and compliance within the system. Remaining concerns (e.g., full GDPR alignment and extensibility for new composite formats) are tracked as future work in the project repository.


\section{Automated Testing}

The GradSight system incorporates automated testing strategies to ensure functionality, code quality, and system stability throughout the development lifecycle. Automated testing is a critical component of the project’s CI/CD pipeline, providing immediate feedback on code changes and ensuring the system remains robust as new features are introduced.

\subsection{ESLint Flow}

ESLint has been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce consistent coding standards and detect potential errors in JavaScript/TypeScript code. It will automatically review each pull request to identify syntax issues, unused variables, and code structure inconsistencies that lead to unsafe practices. Moreover, Developers are required to resolve linting errors before merging changes, ensuring improved maintainability and readability.

\subsection{Unit Testing}

Unit tests will be implemented to validate individual functions, methods, and components. To incorporate this, Playwright will serve as the testing framework for GradSight’s React.js frontend and Node.js backend due to its simplicity, fast performance, and robust mocking capabilities.

Unit tests will focus on critical features such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Composite search logic
\end{itemize}

  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?

 Some things that went well with writing this deliverable were that we had clear alignment with the project goals. The structured evaluation format (Initial State, Input, Expected Output, etc.) ensured each test case was precise, measurable, and aligned with our requirements and objectives. And the mapping of each requirement to specific test cases also helped structure our project and tell us what we had and what we need to do.
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?

    Some pain points we experienced during this deliverable were inconsistent testing results; early on, inconsistent results in OCR accuracy and composite uploads caused delays. We eventually got through this by modifying our OCR many times. The other pain point was evaluating every requirement. Due to the nature of our product and final steps, it was difficult to accomplish some requirements, specifically operational and environmental requirements. After consulting with IT department, these requirements are not needed and thus not applicable to our product.

  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  
  Some parts of the document that stemmed from speaking to our client were:
  
  Accessibility Testing: The stakeholder feedback emphasized that we ensure the platform was accessible to all users, leading to expanded accessibility test cases.\\
  
FR’s and NFR’s: Changes to our requirements were made after discussing with stakeholders like the IT department. Not being able to move forward with displaying this at McMaster, completely adjusted our NFR, specifically operation and environmental. Some other feedback from stakeholders made us evaluate our requirements little differently. Additionally, changes to the unit tests were from stakeholder feedback. We adjusted functionality for the front-end according to new features, and thus changed testing approaches for new pieces of code.\\
\\Performance Expectations: The client emphasized the importance of fast search speeds and responsive composite browsing, influencing our focus on speed and latency testing. We decided to move forward with a separation of concerns approach to reduce latency as much as possible. For scripts, they were done asynchronously, thus saving significant time from customer experience.\\

Sections that did not require changes pertain to error-handling scenarios and edge case testing. These were primarily driven by internal technical decisions.
Additionally, automated testing remained the same since our internal development decisions did not change. We still have our existing workflows for pushing new features. The unit testing, ESLINT configuration, are all part of our existing workflows.
Once again, code coverage remains the same as well since our technology stack has not changed and have remained consistent throughout the development.

  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)

  During the GradSight project, our initial Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan outlined key testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and UI testing, to ensure system quality. While the original plan provided a solid foundation, several deviations occurred due to unforeseen challenges and evolving project needs. \\

 \textbf{Differences:} \\
\\1. Shift in Testing Priorities: \\
Initially, our plan emphasized extensive unit testing for individual functions. However, as the project progressed, we realized that critical issues were more prominent at the integration level, particularly in connecting the frontend, backend, and AWS services. As a result, we shifted focus to integration testing to address these concerns. \\
\\2. Expanded End-to-End Testing (E2E):  \\
Our original VnV plan allocated minimal time to E2E testing. However, we found that comprehensive E2E testing was necessary to confirm that user workflows (e.g., composite uploads, remove students, mange composites) performed consistently across various environments.\\
To address this, we incorporated Playwright for automated E2E testing alongside our CI/CD pipeline to ensure system reliability during updates.\\
\\ \textbf{Why these changes occurred?}\\

Unexpected System Behavior: \\Early testing exposed issues that were more prominent at the integration level rather than in isolated unit tests.\\
\\Stakeholder feedback:\\ After presenting the product to multiple stakeholders, the feedback amongst the stakeholders were similar in the sense that features like uploading and managing composites should have improved accessibility. Our functionality remains operational and robust. \\
\\\textbf{Anticipating Future Changes}\\
\\Emphasize Error Handling from the Start: \\We will dedicate more time to identifying potential failure points and designing test cases that validate error recovery.\\
\\Use Prototypes for Early Risk Identification: \\Developing small-scale prototypes during initial stages can help identify technical risks sooner\\
